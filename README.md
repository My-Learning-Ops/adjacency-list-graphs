# Learning Graph using Adjacency List in Java

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing the **Graph** data structure using an adjacency list implementation in Java. It serves as a personal study project to understand graph concepts, traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), and basic graph operations.

### Resources Used for Learning

This project is purely for educational purposes. I studied this data structure using various external resources including tutorials, documentation, and online courses to deepen my understanding.
